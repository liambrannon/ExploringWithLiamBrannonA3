            <b> Who is Liam Brannon?</b>
            <p>
              My name is Liam Brannon, I am a 19 year old university student at
              Dalhousie University, who also dreams of travelling the world.
              Ever since I was a young child I never had a certain career path
              or goal like some of the other kids my age, but I knew one thing,
              I wanted to see the world. I have always been fascinated by
              different countries and cultures and dreamt of experiencing them.
              I plan on travelling to every country on the globe, big and small,
              far and wide, I want to meet people from every culture I possibly
              can, and share my experiences with people like <b>YOU</b>. I aim
              to show my audience the hidden beauty in all areas of the world,
              from the people, environments, foods, etc. My ultimate goal is
              simply that, and I hope you can join me for the ride because we
              are just getting started!
