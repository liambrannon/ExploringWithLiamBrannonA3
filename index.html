            Summary and rating of trip: <br />
            I travelled to New York City in August of 2022, and was overjoyed by
            the shear size of the city! I went with my family and we had a blast
            eating great food from so many different cultures, sightseeing
            around Manhattan, and shopping of course! NYC is a very diverse city
            with so much to find that it is nearly impossible to run out of
            things to do. We stayed at the
            <a

              >Shelburn Sonesta Hotel
            </a>
            which was beautiful inside, and the staff were extremely friendly.
            Overall, I would give New York City a <u>8.8/10</u> score based on
            cost, transportation and accessibility, entertainment/atttractions,
            and of course the food.

            <h3><b>Why Japan is my #1 destination: </b></h3>
            <p>
              During 2019 my family had planned on going to Kyoto in the next
              year for vacation, as we had family living there at the time we
              could stay with. Sadly, the next year did not go as planned and
              Covid-19 caused us to have to cancel the family trip. We were
              devastated because at the time me and my younger sister had never
              travelled outside of Canada before and we were really looking for
              ward to it, but eventually we got over it and got through the 2020
              pandemic without thinking about the cancelled trip very much. 4
              years later, I am now 19 and over the past few years my
              fascination with Japan has grown more than ever, I have a strong
              love for fashion, cars, architecture, nature, history, and food. I
              think about going to Japan almost everyday now and use it as
              motivation for getting through certain tasks. Another
              disappointing event was when we learned that the relatives we had
              that lived in Kyoto, now moved back to Canada so staying with them
              is no longer an option, but one day I will go to Japan and I am so
              excited for when that day comes! <br />
